# Travel Advisor

This project is a Tripadvisor-like website that helps people to find the best restaurants, hotels, and attractions in any city they would like to visit. It includes a Google map that displays the entire city with its popular places on it. All that is needed from users is to type their destination in the search field and the map will show them what places to visit and provide them information about each place. Once the website is loaded, it detects the user's location and displays the best places around their location.
